            <div class="text-right">
                <p>Simply put, a professionally staged home sells faster and for more money than a comparable home with no interior marketing plan.</p>
                <p>The National Association of Realtors estimates that professionally staging your home can add 8-10% to the selling price.</p>
                <p>Professionally staged homes spend 83% less time on the market than non-staged homes (HomeGain.com).</p>
                <p>Most home buyers look at hundreds of listings online. As a seller, you only have a few seconds to make a great impression. A professionally staged home is designed to photograph well. Your listing will get clicked on more often.</p>
                <p>When the buyer tours the home, that great first impression turns to a great lasting impression. When a buyer walks into a clean, cohesive, and inspiring interior, they begin to emotionally inhabit the space. Now you are not only selling the property, but the lifestyle it represents.</p>

        <h1 style="text-align: left;">Our Design Philosophy</h1>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;">How are we different?</h3>

        <div class="value-full-text">

          <p>Home staging is your property’s Visual Marketing Plan. We believe the greatest value of a properly staged home
          is the opportunity to emotionally connect with buyers. Our approach to staging your home goes way beyond placing
          furniture in empty rooms. In today's competitive real estate market, using furnishings that are on trend is just the
          beginning.</p>
                  <p>ReadySet Staging also considers the most likely type of buyer for the neighborhood and uses that information to hit
          the design sweet spot that will connect emotionally with motivated buyers. Our approach takes into account:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Current market competition and conditions</li>
              <li>Neighborhood demographics</li>
              <li>Property architecture and landscape</li>
              <li>Interior sightlines, room layout, and traffic flow</li>
              <li>Color and lighting theory</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>What To Expect</h2>
        <h3>We Make It Easy.</h3>
        <p>We want your house to sell as quickly as you do. We have streamlined our process to four easy steps.</p>

        
        <h3>1. Onsite Consultation</h3>
        <p>Our designer will meet you at your property to tour the home and discuss your timeline, budget, and needs. We will
           photograph and take measurements of the areas to be staged. (30-45 minutes)</p>

       
        <h3>2. Finalize Plan</h3>
        <p>We will work with you to clearly define the scope and budget of the project.</p>

       
        <h3>3. Implementation of Design</h3>
        <p>On your scheduled staging day, our staff works their magic to transform your property into a listing that every
           serious buyer will want to tour.</p>

        
        <h3>4. De-Stage</h3>
        <p>Once your house has sold, contact us to give us the good news and we will come back to remove the staging
           items.</p>
